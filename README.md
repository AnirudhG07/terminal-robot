# Terminal-robotðŸ¤–
The terminal-robot is a fun feature you can add to your terminal to get a speaking robot.
You can easily run the python code. Enter the text you would like the robot to say and it will speak in a robotic-y voice with mouth movements!

# How to use
Follow the given steps and get yourself a talking robot-
1. git clone the repository in your home
2. Install dependencies in your environment
3. run the python program using `python3 robot_main.py`

# Dependencies
```bash
python3 -m pip install opencv-python
python3 -m pip install metaphone
python3 -m pip install _thread
```
Make sure to have this in your environment before running this application else "No module named `libarary`" may show up.

# Contributions
1. Put it in homebrew so as to directly get it to run in terminal.
```bash
brew install terminal-robot
terminal-robot
```
```bash
Hi I am your terminal assistant. How can i help you?
```
2. Make this robot as a terminal assistant with chatbot to actually answer your terminal queries and give suggestions for errors
3. Add more features like changing robot face, robot talking speed and all. Since I have used espeak, it can be done without much difficulty.
4. More ideas and suggestions...
